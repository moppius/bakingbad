# What the heck?
_In last week's episode of Baking Bad..._

This is a repo to gather baking recipes (and even recipes that are not baking,
who cares, really, in these times of uncertainty)

## Recipes

* None yet!

# I want to add a new recipe

Just fork the repo, add a .md file in `/recipes` and send a pull request!

# What recipes are you looking for?

Take a look at the open [issues](https://github.com/tomchop/bakingbad/issues).

# I have an idea that would make this less idea less stupid

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/tomchop/bakingbad/issues/new), nothing
 is fixed, everything can change.

# Will there be a nicer website than just recipes?

Yes. Soon. I promise. Maybe.
